### Set Up, Load Data
```{r}
## load packages
library(dplyr)

## read in data
births = read.csv("data/Yr1116Birth.csv", na.strings = c("9","99","9999"))
deaths = read.csv("data/Yr1116Death.csv", na.strings = c("9","99","9999"))

## add back in county 99
births$CORES[which(is.na(births$CORES))] = 99
deaths$cores[which(is.na(deaths$cores))] = 99

```


```{r}
#calculate infant mortality by county

deaths_by_county = deaths %>%
  # filter(!is.na(cores)) %>%
  group_by(cores) %>%
  summarize(n_deaths = n()) %>%
  rename(CORES=cores)

births_by_county = births %>%
  # filter(!is.na(CORES)) %>%
  group_by(CORES) %>%
  summarize(n_births = n())

infant_mortality = merge(deaths_by_county, births_by_county, by = "CORES") %>%
  mutate(mortality = n_deaths/n_births) %>%
  select(-n_births, -n_deaths)

birth1 = merge(births, infant_mortality, by = "CORES")
```
